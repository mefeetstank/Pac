# PacMan

* Pac-Man: The main character controlled by the player. Pac-Man is a yellow, circular character with a large mouth that opens and closes as he moves through the maze. The player guides Pac-Man using a joystick or arrow keys, with the objective of clearing the maze of dots.

* Ghosts: Pac-Man's adversaries. There are four ghosts in the game: Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange). Each ghost has its own behavior pattern and movement strategy, making them challenging obstacles for Pac-Man. If a ghost catches Pac-Man, he loses a life.

* Maze: The playing area where Pac-Man moves around. The maze is filled with dots that Pac-Man must eat to progress through the game. There are also larger, dots called "power pellets" that, when eaten, temporarily allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts by making them vulnerable to being eaten.

* Scoring: Points are awarded for eating dots, eating ghosts.
